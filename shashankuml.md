# 🛡️ Automated Fraud Detection & Alerting System

## 1. Project Overview
The **Automated Fraud Detection & Alerting System** is a real-time intelligent system designed to monitor financial transactions, detect fraudulent activities using rule-based and ML-driven techniques, and immediately alert stakeholders to minimize financial loss.

The system integrates **authentication mechanisms**, **behavioral analytics**, **risk scoring**, and **machine learning models** to identify suspicious activities such as credit card fraud, account takeover, phishing, and identity theft.

## 2. System Scope & Objectives

### Objectives:
- Detect fraud in real-time
- Reduce false positives using ML
- Automate alerts and preventive actions
- Provide dashboards and reports for management
- Continuously learn and adapt to new fraud patterns

### System Boundary:
All activities shown inside the UML system boundary belong to the **Automated Fraud Detection System**, while actors interact externally.
