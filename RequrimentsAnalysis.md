# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
## Project: Automated Fraud Detection and Alerting System

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 23-01-2026

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of the Automated Fraud Detection and Alerting System is to provide financial institutions with a robust, real-time mechanism to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. Unlike traditional batch-processing systems, this software aims to detect anomalies at the moment of the transaction, drastically reducing financial liability for both the bank and the customer.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
With the exponential rise in digital banking, financial fraud has evolved from simple card theft to complex synthetic identity fraud and account takeovers. Existing legacy systems often rely on static rules (e.g., "deny if amount > $5000"), which result in high "False Positive" rates—blocking legitimate customers—and fail to detect new, sophisticated fraud patterns. There is a critical need for a system that learns dynamic behavioral patterns to improve accuracy.

### 1.3 Scope
The product will be a server-side application that integrates with a bank's transaction gateway. It will:
* Ingest transaction data in real-time.
* Analyze data using both Rule-Based and Machine Learning engines.
* Generate immediate alerts for suspicious activities.
* Provide a dashboard for fraud analysts to investigate cases.

The system will *not* handle the actual fund transfer but will act as a "Gatekeeper" that approves or flags the transfer request.

### 1.4 Definitions and Acronyms
* **FPR (False Positive Rate):** The percentage of legitimate transactions incorrectly flagged as fraud.
* **PII:** Personally Identifiable Information.
* **ML:** Machine Learning.
* **XAI:** Explainable AI.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Proposed System
The proposed system utilizes a Hybrid approach. It combines:
1.  **Deterministic Rules:** For obvious fraud (e.g., blacklisted IP addresses).
2.  **Probabilistic ML Models:** For subtle fraud (e.g., unusual spending velocity).
This ensures high speed (via rules) and high accuracy (via ML).

### 2.2 User Characteristics
* **End User (Bank Customer):** Non-technical. Needs reassurance that their money is safe and expects minimal disruption to legitimate spending.
* **Fraud Analyst:** Technical domain expert. Needs detailed data to investigate why a transaction was flagged.
* **System Administrator:** Technical expert. Responsible for system uptime, model retraining, and user management.

### 2.3 Assumptions and Dependencies
* The system assumes access to a stream of transaction data from the bank's core banking system.
* The system relies on a stable internet connection for sending real-time alerts (SMS/Email).
* Historical transaction data is available to train the initial ML models.

## 3. Functional Requirements
*This section defines the specific behaviors of the system using formal "The system shall..." statements.*

### 3.1 Module 1: Data Ingestion & Validation
* **FR-1.1:** The system shall accept JSON-formatted transaction streams containing Transaction ID, Amount, Timestamp, Merchant ID, User ID, and Location.
* **FR-1.2:** The system shall validate all incoming fields and reject malformed data packets with an error log.
* **FR-1.3:** The system shall normalize currency values to a standard base currency (e.g., USD) before analysis.

### 3.2 Module 2: The Detection Engine
* **FR-2.1 (Rule-Based):** The system shall flag any transaction exceeding a configurable maximum threshold (e.g., $10,000) within a single instance.
* **FR-2.2 (Velocity Check):** The system shall flag accounts that attempt more than 5 transactions within a 1-minute window.
* **FR-2.3 (ML-Based):** The system shall utilize a Supervised Learning model (e.g., Random Forest or Isolation Forest) to generate a "Fraud Probability Score" between 0.0 and 1.0.
* **FR-2.4:** The system shall mark any transaction with a Score > 0.8 as "High Risk."

### 3.3 Module 3: Alerting and Action
* **FR-3.1:** The system shall trigger an email and SMS alert to the registered user within 5 seconds of detecting a "High Risk" transaction.
* **FR-3.2:** The system shall provide an API endpoint to "Freeze" the transaction status, preventing funds from moving until the alert is resolved.
* **FR-3.3:** The system shall allow the user to reply to the alert (e.g., "Yes, this was me") to immediately unfreeze the transaction.

### 3.4 Module 4: Analytics Dashboard
* **FR-4.1:** The system shall display a real-time heatmap of global fraud attempts on the administrator dashboard.
* **FR-4.2:** The system shall allow analysts to filter historical alerts by Date, Severity, and Merchant Category.
* **FR-4.3:** The system shall generate a monthly "Fraud Trends Report" in PDF format.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
*These requirements ensure the system meets performance standards critical for financial security.*

### 4.1 Performance (Latency)
* **NFR-1:** The system shall process an incoming transaction and return a "Safe/Suspicious" verdict within **200 milliseconds**.

### 4.2 Scalability
* **NFR-2:** The system architecture shall support horizontal scaling to handle spikes of up to **1,000 transactions per second** (TPS).

### 4.3 Security
* **NFR-3:** All PII (Personally Identifiable Information) stored in the database shall be encrypted using **AES-256**.
* **NFR-4:** System access shall be protected by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all Administrator and Analyst accounts.

### 4.4 Reliability
* **NFR-5:** The system shall maintain **99.9% availability** (uptime) during banking hours.

## 5. Innovation & Novelty 
*To differentiate this project from standard implementations, the following innovative features are included:*

### 5.1 Behavioral Biometrics Integration
The system shall not strictly rely on transactional data. It shall ingest device telemetry (mouse movement patterns, typing cadence on mobile apps) to verify if the person initiating the transfer matches the biometrics of the account owner.

### 5.2 Explainable AI (XAI) "Why-was-I-blocked?"
Standard ML models are "black boxes." This system shall include an interpretation layer (using SHAP values) that provides a human-readable reason for every block.
* *Example Output:* "Blocked because transaction location (London) is physically impossible to reach from previous location (NYC) in 30 minutes."

### 5.3 Feedback Loop Learning
The system shall implement an automated retraining pipeline. When a user marks an alert as "False Alarm," the system shall automatically add this data point to the training set and schedule a model update for the next maintenance window.

## 6. System Interface Requirements

### 6.1 Hardware Interfaces
* **Server:** Minimum 16GB RAM, 8-Core Processor (to handle ML inference).
* **Storage:** SSD storage for high-speed log writing.

### 6.2 Software Interfaces
* **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu/CentOS).
* **Language:** Python (for ML components) and Java/Node.js (for high-speed API handling).
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Transactional data) and Redis (Caching for velocity checks).

## 7. Conclusion
The Automated Fraud Detection and Alerting System is designed to be a secure, scalable, and intelligent solution for modern banking. By integrating Novel features like Explainable AI and Biometrics, it addresses the key weaknesses of current legacy systems—specifically the high rate of false positives—while ensuring a seamless experience for the end-user.
